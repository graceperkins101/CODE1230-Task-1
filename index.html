       waste of space because no one was using it. The people and the government wanted to transform it because they thought it

       being transformed into a new waterfront financial district with a mix of office space, residential 
       buildings, shopping, dining, hotel, hospitality and public spaces which enhances. It will become home 
       to around 1,800 residents and 23,000 office workers and, with more than 50% of the precinct open 
       public space and 100% of the foreshore to be fully accessible to pedestrians and cyclists, it is
